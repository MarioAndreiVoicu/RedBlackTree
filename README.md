# Red-Black Tree (RBT) Implementation in C++

This is a C++ implementation of a Red-Black Tree (RBT). The implementation includes the following functions:

- **Insertion:** Inserts a key-value pair into the RBT while maintaining its properties.
- **Deletion:** Deletes a key-value pair from the RBT and rebalances it as necessary.
- **Search:** Finds a key in the RBT and returns its associated value.
- **Maximum and Minimum:** Finds the maximum and minimum keys in the RBT.
- **Successor and Predecessor:** Finds the successor and predecessor of a given key in the RBT.
- **Display:** Provides options to display the contents of the RBT in pre-order, in-order, or post-order traversal.
- **Clear:** Clears the RBT, removing all elements.
- **Empty:** Checks if the RBT is empty.

## Usage

1. **Include Header:** Add `#include "RedBlackTree.h"` to your C++ source files where you want to use the RBT implementation.
2. **Instantiate RBT:** Create an RBT object with the desired key and value types. For example: RBT<int,char> tree
